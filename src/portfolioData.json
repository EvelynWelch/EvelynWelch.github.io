I am a recent gratuate from Southwest Technical College's Software Development program, who has been casually coding for years.My gernal philosophy when I was teaching myself to code was turning as many unknown unknowns, into known unknowns. Coding struck me as a field where knowing what you can do, is more important than how you can do it. If you know it can be done, you can probably find how to do it. When I decided to make turn coding into a career I registered at the local tech college to try and make sure there wasn't anything I missed, and have since graduated and am looking for my first job in the field."
